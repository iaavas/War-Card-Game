# War Card Game CLI Simulation in Python
This is a command-line interface (CLI) simulation of the popular card game War, implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to win all the cards. The deck is divided evenly among the players, and each player reveals the top card of their deck. The player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck. If there's a tie, the players continue to reveal cards until one player wins.

This implementation allows for playing against the computer or against another human player. The game is turn-based, with each player taking their turn by pressing Enter. The game continues until one player has all the cards or until a specified number of rounds is reached.

## Features
* Computer vs Computer Battle.
* Random shuffling of the deck at the start of each round.
* CLI interface with clear prompts and instructions.

## Requirements
This simulation requires Python 3.6 or higher. No additional packages are needed.

# Usage
To start the game, simply run the war_game.py script in your terminal:

```
python war_game.py

```


## Acknowledgments
This implementation is based on the rules of the War card game, which is a popular game that has been played for centuries. The code and interface design were created by [your name], who is passionate about Python and game development.


# Future Improvements
Add a graphical interface using a Python GUI library.
Implement different card decks and card back designs.
Add sound effects and animations for more engaging gameplay.
Implement an AI algorithm to improve the computer player's strategy.
